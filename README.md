# kubernetes cluster with nodes
In this repo you will find scripts, and how-tos on Kubernetes and OpenShift used in ML (Machine Learning).

# DO NOT USE ANY HOW-TO`S OR SCRIPTS BEFORE THIS TEXT (IN CAPITAL LETTERS) IS REMOVED! 
RIGHT NOW ALMOST EVERYTHING IS A "WORK IN PROGRESS" (BETA)

The scripts and how-to`s will show you an "easy way" to contribute to the ML society.

This repo will be closely attached to the other repos on the subject of ML at https://github.com/iceexplorer

As of now the install scripts of Kubernetes is not working properly on the Calico (CNI plugin) installation. Please use the how-to ( to be found here; https://docs.tigera.io/calico/latest/getting-started/kubernetes/hardway/install-cni-plugin ) to fix it manually. This will be implementes as soon as I find time to do so :D
