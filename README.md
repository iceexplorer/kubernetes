# kubernetes cluster with nodes
In this repo you will find scripts, and how-tos on Kubernetes and OpenShift used in ML (Machine Learning).

DO NOT USE ANY HOW-TO`S OR SCRIPTS BEFORE THIS TEXT (IN CAPITAL LETTERS) IS REMOVED! RIGHT NOW ALMOST EVERYTHING IS A "WORK IN PROGRESS" (ALPHA)

The scripts and how-to`s will show you an "easy way" to contribute to the ML society.

This repo will be closely attached to the other repos on the subject of ML at https://github.com/iceexplorer
