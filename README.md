In this repo you will find scripts, and how-tos on Kubernetes and OpenShift used in ML (Machine Learning).

The scripts and how-to`s will show you an "easy way" to be a contributing part of the ML society. AI?? It just does not exist right now. Let us talk about it in about 5 - 10 years...

This repo will be closely attached to the other repos on the subject of ML at https://github.com/iceexplorer
